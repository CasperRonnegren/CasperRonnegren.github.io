                        For this project, I went through the process of implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Bird-Oid Objects</a> (Boids) through Unity's 
                        <a href="https://unity.com/resources/introduction-to-dots-ebook">Data-Oriented Technology Stack</a> (DOTS).
                        Implementing boids is something I had done before, so the goal this time around was to try and see how scalable I could make the implementation through the technologies available with DOTS.
                        While working on the project, I also learned of an optimization technique called 
                        <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/spatial-hashing-r2697/">Spatial Hashing</a>
                        and decided to incorporate into the final solution.
                        In the end, the two-faceted approach of utilizing both DOTS and Spatial Hashing proved to be an incredibly powerful combination that immensely improved scalability.

                        The aim of boids is to simulate the flocking behavior of birds.
                        Flocking is accomplished through the combination of three <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/">Steering Behaviors</a> 
                        which each contribute a force used for the movement of a boid.
                        The three steering behaviors used in this case utilize the position and heading of other boids within a minimum distance
                        to calculate movement which emulates flocking behavior.

                        Implementing steering behaviors is usually not too difficult as each one in isolation tends to be quite simple in their logic.
                        The tricky part is combining them as you have to intricately balance the force each steering behavior contributes towards the final behavior.
                        When you don't get the final behavior you want, it can be hard to tell which steering behavior is the cause of unintended movement, 
                        and whether the problem lies with the variables used or how the math itself is set up in the behaviour.
                        From my experience, it helps immensely to have gizmos display the different forces contributed by each steering behavior as it makes it easy
                        to see if any of them is doing something unintended.

                    <h3>Optimizations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Data-Oriented Technology Stack Unity has is composed of three central technologies: the Entity Component System (ECS), the Job System, and the Burst Compiler.
                        The Unity ECS is a typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a>, 
                        but integrated into the engine and works as an alternative to <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html">MonoBehaviour</a>.
                        As for the Job System, it is used to create multithreaded code by scheduling code as "jobs" to be done.
                        Finally, the Burst Compiler is black magic which you enable through a singular button press that somehow results in your code becoming 
                        faster by translating it into ancient forbidden scriptures.
                        In the end, most of the time spent in this project ended up going to learning how the ECS and Job Systems work and implementing boids through them.
                        The Burst Compiler does also have its own restrictions you need to work around, but you're pretty much already doing that when working with the ECS and Job System.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to scalability, a problem that becomes apparent with boids is that each boid has to iterate over every other boid to do 
                        the calculations for its steering behaviors, which entails an O(nÂ²) time complexity.
                        As boids too far away won't even affect each other, this means a lot of processing time is wasted solely on the task of calculating
                        if boids are within the minimum distance of each other to have an influence on their respective steering behaviors.
                        While doing a simple distance calculation is quite fast, when you have 40 000 boids that each needs the distance to the other
                        39 999 boids, the processing time adds up.
                        Depending on how the space the boids are contained in is set up, it may be the case that not even 0.1% of those 39 999 boids fulfill the
                        minimum distance requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To reduce the amount of distance calculations required, I implemented Spatial Hashing which works by dividing space into discrete chunks.
                        All boids start off by finding which chunk they're in by calculating their "spatial hash."
                        After that, rather than every boid iterating over every other boid that exists, a boid can instead use their spatial hash to find which chunk they are in
                        and then only need to iterate over boids within that chunk and chunks close enough to possibly contain boids which fulfill the minimum
                        distance requirement.
                        Assigning spatial hashes can be done with an O(n) time complexity, so this has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of processing time required 
                        when managing a large amount of boids.

                        Down below are three graphs comparing the performance between 400, 4 000, and 40 000 boids.
                        In addition to just changing the amount of boids, I've also compared turning certain optimizations on and off.<br>

                    <p style ="text-align: center">I was unable to get a number for Singular without Burst Compiler as Unity would crash when trying.</p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
                    <p>
                        As can be seen from the graphs, the performance of the boids implementation improves the more optimizations are enabled.
                        These benefits also become greater the higher the amount of boids is.
                        Unfortunately, all test results use the Unity ECS as I don't have a non-ECS implementation to make fair comparisons to.
                        All in all, the most surprising result to me is how potent the Burst Compiler is.
                        The other optimizations all required effort to get working whereas the Burst Compiler I just had to enable in a menu, so I wouldn't
                        expect it do bring great benefits, but I was quite wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something that may be of curiosity in the results is how the graph for 400 boids differs from the other two.
                        This can be explained by the fact that the optimizations in place cannot be fully utilized at such a small number.
                        When it comes to the Jobs System, the work scheduled isn't completely evenly divided between worker threads in this case.
                        This has to do with the facts that the ECS stores up to a maximum of 128 entities in a single memory chunk.
                        Because of this, when jobs are scheduled for entities, each job may pertain to a maximum of 128 entities each.
                        In the case of 400 boids, the work would result in 4 jobs allocated to a worker thread each instead of the work
                        being evenly divided between every thread available.
                        When the amount of boids is increased to 4 000, it creates more jobs which results in more worker threads being utilized
                        and therefore provides greater benefits from doing work in parallel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for why Spatial Hashing doesn't have as much of an effect at 400 boids compared to higher amounts, it's simply due to the fact that the O(nÂ²) 
                        time complexity without Spatial Hashing isn't that significant of a problem.
                        The Burst Compiler resulting in similar results across the board at 400 boids is probably because it can rush through the code so fast that the 
                        majority of frametime just ends up going to other factors like rendering.

                <div class="col-12 col-12-medium"><h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p>
                        I learned quite a lot from this project as it was the first time I got to work with Multi-Threading and an Entity Component System.
                        All in all, the overarching concepts weren't too difficult to learn as the <a href="https://unity.com/resources/introduction-to-dots-ebook">Unity E-Book</a> explained them quite well.
                        More difficult was acclimating to the code structure which differs somewhat from what I'm accustomed to, and of course learning the syntax which could be scary at times when you find stuff like
                        <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@0.2/api/Unity.Collections.IJobNativeMultiHashMapMergedSharedKeyIndices.html">IJobNativeMultiHashMapMergedSharedKeyIndices</a>
                        in sample projects.
                        Spatial Hashing was something I learned of on the side while working on the project and wasn't something I originally planned to have in it, but after reading a blog post about it, I came to
                        the conclusion that it wouldn't be too hard to implement, so I went ahead and did it.
                        I'm glad I did because it proved to be valuable for this project, and it may very likely be a solution I use again in the future if I ever encounter a similar problem.
