                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this project, me and a classmate decided to make a simple multiplayer game for the course we were taking.
                        I refer to it as simple, but that can be quite deceptive as it is the gameplay that was designed to be simpled whereas the underlying architecture ended up becoming quite complex.
                        Originally, we used Unity's high-level networking library, <a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/">Netcode for GameObjects</a>, 
                        to make the game, which we learned to use through <a href="https://unity.com/resources/ultimate-guide-advanced-multiplayer-networking">Unity's e-book</a> about multiplayer within the engine.
                        However, we quickly encountered a problem, and that was that we finished the game within the first week.
                        As the deadline was a month away, we decided to switch to using Unity's low-level networking library, <a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/transport/current/about/">Unity Transport</a>, which proved to be significantly more of a challenge.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, the gameplay is quite simple. 
                    The focus of the project was the underlying multiplayer architecture, 
                    so I tried coming up with an idea for a game where multiplayer itself is essential, but the development time for non-multiplayer aspects is kept minimal.
                    As for the game, the goal is for two players to cooperate in order to move upwards until the progress bar in the middle fills up which results in them winning.
                    To progress upwards, players can jump, move to the left or right, and also shoot shapes in the direction of their cursor by left-clicking.
                    A shape shot by a player stops in place once they press left-click once more.
                    The problem players face is that they are divided by a barrier (the yellow area), and cannot stop shapes in place on their side of the barrier.
                    Thus, to progress upwards, the players have to cooperate by shooting shapes over to each other which they can jump onto.
                    For added difficulty, we made the shapes to be fired randomized and made it so each player can only have 2 shapes in place at once.
